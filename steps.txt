6. Local app setup 

1. HTML and backend setup -

- Make sure you have build folder and index.html in it 
- In the same folder, you should have simple express server with these lines

```
import express from "express";
import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
[declaring app and port variables]
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "build")));
[simple hello saad api]
[simple hello world api]
app.get("/*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "build", "index.html"));
});
[app.listen]
```

2. React Vite + Backend setup 
- In server do the same steps as local html (make build and all that bs)
- In client with vite, do hello world test
- Make sure hello world in react is working (npm run dev)
- cd client
- npm run build 
-> This creates a dist folder which is an optimized folder for your react app 
(delete the build from server)
- mv dist ../server
- cd server
- open app.js and and change all build folder to dist
- npm start
